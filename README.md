# CardSwipeSwift
This repo is a simplified swipe-to-dismiss card style view so you can transition between other views and content. I have modeled it off of various apps and tutorials such as Tinder. My main purpose was to try and simplify the effects of the card style structure by not using pod installs or other dependencies, but doing so without sacrificing a lot of functionality and user experiences such as animations.
